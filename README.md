# StakeNest

Stake a token, earn a fixed APR, withdraw any time.

Deposit the stake token into the vault. Rewards accrue every second at the vault APR and are paid from a reward pool that anyone can fund.

## Run
1. Serve this folder: `python3 -m http.server 8080` and open http://localhost:8080
2. Click **Connect wallet**. The app adds/switches to BOT Chain Testnet (Chain ID 968, RPC https://rpc.bohr.life, explorer https://scan.botchain.ai).
3. Click **Deploy new copy** (deploys the test token(s) and StakeNest), or paste an existing address and click **Use this address**. To pin an address for everyone, set `address` in config.js.
4. Use **Get test tokens** and **Approve**, then the action cards.

## Manual deploy (Remix)
Open contracts/StakeNest.sol, compile with 0.8.20+ (EVM version paris), deploy TestToken first, then StakeNest with the constructor arguments listed in config.js under deploy.args.

## Notes
Testnet demo code, not audited. TestToken has a public faucet and mint.
